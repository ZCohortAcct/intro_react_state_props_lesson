PACKAGE.JSON
  ~ Where all JS app dependencies are held, similar to a Gemfile file in a ruby app
  ~ 'package-lock.json', locks in versions of the dependencies for the application

  IN FILE
  ~ Default packages are installed from the create-react-app
    - 'npm init' will also create a package.json file 
    - default dependencies are react & react dom & react scripts

  ~ Scripts are the commands we type into the terminal to involk some code in the app
    -I.E. we use is 'start' script often
      â‡’ 'npm start' ~> starts your app

PUBLIC (folder)
  ~ Important file is 'index.html'
  ~ 'index.html' file is the 'single page' the entire app renders too

SRC
  ~ Contains the logic for your React app
  ~ Home to main component 'App.js' & main JS file 'index.js' live
  ~ Where add folders like component, images, reducers, actions (eventually) etc etc
  ~ Files to NEVER delete 'serviceWorker.js' & 'index.js', vital files for app to function 

  INDEX.JS
    ~ First lines import dependencies, no additional setup needed
    ~ Provided with a global index.css file
      - equalivant to a global styling sheet
      - can remove and or make changes to this file
    ~ 'import App', very important b/c it's the main component
      - everything starts here
    ~ Import service worker, handles porting and backend stuff create-react-app needs
    ~ Line 7 is how info rendered in App component shows up in the DOM
